Its capabilities are limited in comparison to a true data source, and implementing a data source via an external program is likely to hurt the portability of your Terraform configuration by creating dependencies on external programs and libraries that may not be available (or may need to be used differently) on different operating systems.\n\n**Warning** Terraform Enterprise does not guarantee availability of any particular language runtimes or external programs beyond standard shell utilities, so it is not recommended to use this data source within configurations that are applied within Terraform Enterprise.",
